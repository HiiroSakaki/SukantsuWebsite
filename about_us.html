  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>Sukantsu is made by three french students as part of their final project for the second year at EPITA, a French programming engineer school. <br>
    The group as a team is called Charleston and is composed of Thibault "Hiiro Sakaki" Buatois, Nicolas "Reaper" Memeint, and Manuel "Neral" Tertre. <br>
    Sukantsu is written in C, using standard library and CSFML library. Code is open-source, available through the download link on the front page. <br>
    The Website is made entirely from scratch using html and css.</p>
